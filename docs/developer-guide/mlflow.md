# MLflow

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It tackles three primary functions:

- Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (MLflow Tracking).
- Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form to share with other data scientists or transfer to production (MLflow Projects).
- Managing and deploying models from various ML libraries to different model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models).
